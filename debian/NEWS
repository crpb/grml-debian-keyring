grml-debian-keyring (2018.06.02) grml-testing; urgency=medium

  This update of the grml-archive-keyring package doesn't include
  any changes within the keyring file itself, but in the way where
  the key is installed to.
  https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/UseThirdParty provides
  more general documentation about the setup.

  Please be aware that this update intentionally does *NOT* remove
  /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/grml-archive.gpg from your system, while
  previous versions of this package shipped the file.  We try to
  avoid breaking existing installations which use the Grml
  repository (having /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/grml-archive.gpg
  installed from the grml-debian-keyring Debian package, while a
  file like /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/grml.gpg was manually installed
  but removed later on).

  If you're using Debian/stretch or newer, starting with this
  version of the grml-archive-keyring package you can use a
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grml.sources setup like:

    Types: deb deb-src
    URIs: http://deb.grml.org/
    Suites: grml-stable grml-testing
    Architectures: i386 amd64
    Components: main
    Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/grml-archive-keyring.gpg

  If you prefer the common sources.list setup, you can instead use
  a  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grml.list like
  (assuming you have apt-transport-https support, otherwise use http instead of https)::

    deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/grml-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.grml.org/ grml-stable  main
    deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/grml-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.grml.org/ grml-testing main
