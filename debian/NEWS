grml-keyring (2025.03.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  We reverted the APT sources configuration file change as shipped with
  version 2025.02.24 due to user feedback (see e.g.
  https://github.com/grml/grml-keyring/issues/18).

  We therefore no longer ship the symlink
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grml.sources pointing to
  /usr/share/grml-keyring/grml.sources via the grml-keyring package.

  If you still want to get the Grml APT repository enabled and managed
  through the grml-keyring Debian package, you can run:

    # ln -s /usr/share/grml-keyring/grml.sources /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grml.sources

grml-keyring (2025.02.24) unstable; urgency=medium

  This package now installs an APT sources configuration file.
  It may conflict with your pre-existing configuration, and APT may complain
  like this:

    $ apt update
    E: Conflicting values set for option Signed-By regarding source
       http://deb.grml.org/ grml-testing: ...
    E: The list of sources could not be read.

  If this is the case, please delete your old configuration for
  deb.grml.org.
