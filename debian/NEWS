grml-keyring (2025.02.24) unstable; urgency=medium

  This package now installs an APT sources configuration file.
  It may conflict with your pre-existing configuration, and APT may complain
  like this:

    $ apt update
    E: Conflicting values set for option Signed-By regarding source
       http://deb.grml.org/ grml-testing: ...
    E: The list of sources could not be read.

  If this is the case, please delete your old configuration for
  deb.grml.org.
